A web application that allows users to search across 2500+ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems using natural language queries.  
For example: *“medium level dynamic programming problems”*.  
Built with **React.js** and **Next.js**, this project provides a fast and intuitive way to discover coding challenges.
